REQ-6 and REQ-7 cannot be confirmed from the diff summary because the relevant file contents are not shown and the files were not deleted (only modified). The diff also includes substantial unrelated UI/feature work not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff indicates `frontend/public/.well-known/ic-domains` was modified, but the content is not included in the summary, so it's not verifiable that the file was deleted or that it no longer lists the custom domains.",
