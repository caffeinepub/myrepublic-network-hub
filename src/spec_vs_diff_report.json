  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented by adding a new static allowlist file at the IC well-known location with both apex and www domains. REQ-4 cannot be fully verified from the provided diff excerpt because the updated documentation content is truncated before showing the required redeploy, POST registration commands, and verification steps. The diff also includes many unrelated frontend feature/UI changes that were not requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Documentation must include explicit post-deploy steps for apex domain activation on the ICP gateway: (1) add domain to ic-domains, (2) redeploy frontend canister, (3) run a separate curl POST registration for myrepubicnetwork.web.id; also include the analogous www POST command, clarify apex vs www are separate registrations, and include a verification step using https://icp0.io/registrations/<id>.",
      "reason": "The updated frontend/docs/custom-domain.md is truncated in the diff summary right after introducing the ic-domains file, so the required explicit redeploy step, curl POST commands (apex and www), and the registrations/<id> verification step are not visible and cannot be confirmed as implemented.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks to add an ic-domains allowlist asset and update custom-domain documentation; it explicitly constrains scope and does not request broader frontend functionality or styling changes.",
